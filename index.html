    <h1>Yesterday</h1>
    <p>by The Beatles</p>
    <p>
      Yesterday<br />All my troubles seemed so far away<br />Now it looks as
      though they're here to stay<br />Oh, I believe in yesterday
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly<br />I'm not half the man I used to be<br />There's a shadow
      hanging over me<br />Oh, yesterday came suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
      Why she had to go?<br />I don't know, she wouldn't say<br />I said
      something wrong?<br />Now I long for yesterday
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday<br />Love was such an easy game to play<br />Now I need a place
      to hide away<br />Oh, I believe in yesterday
    </p>
    <p>
      Why she had to go?<br />I don't know, she wouldn't say<br />I said
      something wrong?<br />Now I long for yesterday
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday<br />Love was such an easy game to play<br />Now I need a place
      to hide away<br />Oh, I believe in yesterday
